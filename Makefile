# guidelines for editing this makefile:
#
# - keep it simple -- put complicated commands into scripts inside bin/ (eg install-deps.sh)
# - document targets in the 'help' target
# - distinguish main targets (meant for users) from intermediate targets
# - if you write a new tool that requires compilation:
#      add a compilation target here and move the binary into bin/
# - if you add a dependency on another tool:
#      make sure you edit install-deps.sh to install or prompt to install it
# - keep diagrams/builsys/buildsys.dot in sync with the targets here
#      that is a diagram that is meant to make it easy to understand everything here.

# Pick the right python version.
# If python2 exists, use it. Otherwise, assume python is python2.
ifneq (,$(shell which python2 2>/dev/null))
PYTHON ?= python2

PYTHON ?= python
